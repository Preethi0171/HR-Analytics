**Excited to share the latest data visualization I've created as a data analyst using HR data! 📊👩‍💼**

**HR ANALYTICS USING TABLEAU**

**KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR**:

A Key Performance Indicator are business metrics used by corporates and managers to track and analyze factors which are crucial for the success of the company.


**ATTRITION BY GENDER**:

The orientation and preferences of male & female differ in respect of professional matters. The reasons for attrition amongst gender have also been observed to be different.


**ATTRITION BY DEPARTMENT**:

I analyzed the attrition rate with respect to Department. The dataset has three departments. This analysis can help us know which department has flaws and the department managers can further take measures to improve their employee satisfaction.


**JOB SATISFACTION**:

I analyzed each of the job role with respect to Job satisfaction rate. This analysis can help us know which Job which employee are satisfied with their role. The data contains four ratings 
for job satisfaction i.e., 1 ‘Low’, 2 ‘Medium’, 3 ‘High’, 4 ‘Very High’
